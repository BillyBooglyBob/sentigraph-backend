Activate/deactivate venv environment for Python backend
- source env/bin/activate
- deactivate

FRONTEND:
- Comparison charts
- Chart
  - API send data for every single day for a time range
  - Frontend manipulates for the timeframe (such as imputation & aggregation/MA)`

BACKEND:
Superuser:
- Email: bobbyBob@gmail.com
- Password: BreakingPrice

test users:
- email: a@gmail.com
- password: abcABC11

Development:
- inside backend directory
- docker-compose up -d to run the containers

- Create new app
  - docker-compose exec web python manage.py startapp <appname>
  - Add to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py 

- give permission to save
  - docker-compose exec web bash
  - chown -R 1000:1000 /usr/src/sentigraph_backend/

- install new dependencies, need to rebuild
  - docker-compose up --build
- made changes to files, need to migrate (can do so with entrypoint.sh)
  - docker-compose up -d


Sentiment
- API needs to provide all the data in one go. 
- date in format "90d", need to make relevant change to frontend
  - it can only select last 90d and what not, 90d from when is based
  on the data.
- Learn how to load dataset into database
- Verify data date range so we can at least do some analysis
- Do a small chunk first
- sentiment api not working, how to solve
  - Check sentiment analysis is being done
  - Find where the error occurred (possible location is date equality check)
- Need to reset database since many cached data are wrong
- Frontend intergration
  - Date range selection change
  - Aspect & Multiple companies setup, a selector is missing (I think its aspect)
  - Redux setup (redux query)
- reinstate check cache for sentiment api search after all the testing are good

Auth
- user register, login and logout
- connect to frontend
  - Use Tanstack for request
    - Remove username from all requests
  - Setup Redux to use auth data in multiple locations
    - use login state to change register/logout in the profile
    - use permission to hide admin section of navbar
    1. Setup backend API to retrieve user info
    2. Setup redux toolkit to store user info
    3. Use permission for info hiding
- user's personal list of companies tracked
  - support CRUD operations
  1. Learn how to create the API to add companies to a particular user
  2. Test API 
  3. Implement into code
  4. Learn how to delete
  5. Test API
  6. Implement into code

- Need bearer token in the request header else won't work.


Admin
- CRUD operation on users
  - (GOOD) read users (Only allow data for user with admin permission) 
  - (GOOD) delete user
  - (GOOD) create user
  - (GOOD) update user (need to implement profile page, will use same set of API)

  - create and update seems to have some problem with actually logging in 
    and saving the password correctly
- Implement one operation at a time
  - Implement in the backend
  - Test API
  - Connect to frontend


- user profile page (can modify the page)

- Need to send data like this for create and update user:
{
  "email": "abc@example.com",
  "password1": "1234",
  "password2": "1234"
}

example fetch call:
fetch("/users/", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <token>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    email: "abc@example.com",
    password1: "1234",
    password2: "1234"
  })
})


Postman testing:
- Login first to get access token
- When doing authorised calls, copy token into Authentication -> Bearer Token
- Then can make authorised calls


- Faulty sentiment analysis
  - presumably due to case sensitivity.







- Set up django backend
- Run django in docker
- Set up PostgreSQL with mocked data (real data later since too big)
- Create DB schema
- Sentiment API
  - All data for a company
    - # listings
    - Overall sentiment
  - Sentiment algorithm
  - Sentiment analysis on an aspect of the company
    - Perform analysis, check if aspect for company already exists
    - Also saving the result for future reference
  - Merge data for multiple aspects
  - Merge data for multiple companies
- Integrate with frontend
  - companies/[id]
  - companies-comparison
- Auth
  - User schema (with role/permission)
  - API
    - register 
      - JWT token
      - password encryption
    - login
    - add/remove companies
- Admin
  - API
    - Permission check (user is admin)
    - Return all users
    - CRUD operations

Deployment:
- Split project into two repos:
  - frontend
  - backend
- Deploy backend on a VPS
  - Separate docker-compose.prod.yml
    - add nginx
    - use gunicorn (install and use)
  - Setup nginx
    - Change allowed domains so backend can be exposed to the actual server
  - Configure certbot for ssh
  - Setup .env.prod 
  - 
  - Create super user to test admin
  -

- is docker-compose.prod.yml correct
- is extra docker file necessary
- is certbot configured correctly
- also push to github and pull in droplet


- Deploy frontend on Vercel
